## Overview
The UW Night Market mobile application alleviates long wait line issues that plague popular food festivals. Leveraging a mobile ordering system to facilitate the ordering process between attendees and vendors, the application increases attendee satisfaction and vendor sales. During this yearâ€™s UW Night Market event on May 12th, the application completed 483 orders and generated $4,553 in revenue for ten vendors in four hours.

The mobile application was built as the UW Night Market App team's iSchool capstone project for 2018.

### Database and Authentication: Firebase
**Firebase** is a mobile and web application development platform provided by Google. The UW Night Market App makes use of its **realtime database** to store all orders, vendor information, and event status. **Firebase Cloud Messaging** is also used as a solution to send push notifications to attendees when the status of their order is updated or when an important announcement needs to be made during the event.
